# Original readme

This project is a .NET class library allowing you to control Wifi (802.11) network adapters installed in your Windows machine programmatically.

The library uses the [Native Wifi API](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms705969.aspx), available since Windows Vista and Windows XP SP2 (in a limited fashion, and only after applying a hotfix provided in [KB article 918997](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918997)). Older versions of Windows are not supported.

You can find sample code in the WifiExample directory.

This code was developed as part of our work at [Monfort Software Engineering](http://www.monfort.co.il/).
